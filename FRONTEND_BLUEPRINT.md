## 1. Executive Summary

### What Argus Is

Argus is a **Water Health Intelligence Platform** that fuses free Earth-observation and weather
data into actionable intelligence about water bodies and water-related hazards. It produces
grounded, AI-narrated situation reports across four environmental domains:

| Domain | ID | What it detects |
|---|---|---|
| Marine Oil | `marine_oil` | SAR-detected dark spots / oil slicks |
| Inland Water Quality | `inland_wq` | Algal blooms (chl-a, turbidity, CDOM, surface temp) |
| Weather / Hydro | `weather_hydro` | Precip series, river discharge, SO₂/NO₂ deposition |
| Hydro Choke Points | `hydro_chokepoints` | DEM-derived drainage constriction nodes |

### Current Implementation State

All backend phases are complete as of 2026-06-27:

| Milestone | Features | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0–3: Oil domain | F-000–F-017 | **DONE** |
| Phase 3.5: Hardening | F-018–F-023 | **DONE** |
| Phase 4–5: WQ + prediction | F-024–F-029 | **DONE** |
| Phase 6: AI layer | F-030–F-033 | **DONE** |
| Phase 7: Integration | F-034–F-036 | **DONE** |
| Phase 8: Automation | F-037–F-039 | **DONE** |
| Phase 9: D3+D4 + viewer | F-040–F-044 | **DONE** |
| **Phase 10: Production UI** | **F-045–F-051** | **DONE** (commits 6d258b7, 295bf27) |
| Phase 11: Validation/MVP | F-052–F-056 | TODO (next) |

**[IMPL]** Phase 10 is complete. The React+Vite+Tailwind dashboard is implemented at `frontend/`
and built to `frontend/dist/`. It serves from FastAPI's static file mount in production.
The dashboard includes all 12 pages, design system v2 (typography, shadows, animations),
and realistic demo fixture data for Gulf of Paria, Trinidad.

## 2. Product Capability Overview

### 2.1 Domain Outputs (IMPLEMENTED — all in store)

#### D1: Marine Oil (`marine_oil`)

- **Observation types:** `oil_slick` (evidence_class: `measured`)
- **Predictor:** `OilTrajectory` (kind: `trajectory`)
  - Output: `ForecastFrame[]` — each frame has `footprint` (GeoJSON Polygon),
    `particle_count`, `stats` (mean_lon, mean_lat, spread_km, drift_km)
  - Uncertainty: ensemble spread metrics
- **Impact:** `ImpactAssessment[]` — ETA hours + metrics (coast_length_km, mpa_area_km2)
- **Alert gate:** `should_alert_hab()` not applicable; oil alerts via confidence + ETA
- **UI surfaces:** Oil overlay on map, trajectory animation, ETA cards, impact badges

#### D2: Inland Water Quality (`inland_wq`)

- **Observation types (all measured at Observation level):**
  - `chlorophyll_a` (evidence_class: `measured`) — µg/L, bloom proxy
  - `turbidity` (evidence_class: `measured`) — NTU
  - `cdom` (evidence_class: `measured`) — g/m³
  - `surface_temp` (evidence_class: `measured`) — °C
  - `bloom_presence` (evidence_class: `inferred`) — derived from elevated chl-a proxy
- **Predictors:**
  - `WaterQualityForecast` (kind: `forecast`) — 7-day bloom risk + 90% CI per water body
  - `AnomalyDetector` (kind: `anomaly`) — deviation z-score, direction (positive/negative)
- **Alert gates:**
  - HAB fires when z_score > 2.5σ AND forecast bloom > 25 µg/L
- **UI surfaces:** WQ trend chart, anomaly timeline, bloom forecast bar, AI situation report

#### D3: Weather/Hydrology (`weather_hydro`)

- **Observation types (all modeled):**
  - `precip_series` (evidence_class: `modeled`) — precipitation time series, Open-Meteo
  - `discharge_series` (evidence_class: `modeled`) — river discharge, GloFAS
  - `so2_series` (evidence_class: `modeled`) — SO₂ column, Open-Meteo air quality
  - `no2_series` (evidence_class: `modeled`) — NO₂ column, Open-Meteo air quality
- **Predictors:**
  - `FloodRisk` (kind: `risk`) — risk_level ∈ {low/medium/high/extreme}, risk_score 0–1
  - `AcidDepositionRisk` (kind: `risk`) — acid_risk_index 0–10 (NOT a pH measurement)
- **Alert gates:**
  - Flood: fires when risk_level ∈ {high, extreme}
  - Acid: fires when acid_risk_index ≥ 7.0
- **UI surfaces:** Risk level badge, acid index gauge, Open-Meteo CC BY 4.0 attribution

#### D4: Hydro Choke Points (`hydro_chokepoints`)

- **Output:** `ChokePoint[]` — DEM-derived drainage constriction nodes
  - `location` (GeoJSON Point), `upstream_area_km2`, `constriction_score` 0–1
  - evidence_class: always `inferred` — never `measured`
  - dem_source: `cop_glo30` (Copernicus GLO-30 DEM)
- **UI surfaces:** Circle markers on map, sorted by constriction_score desc

### 2.2 AI Layer (IMPLEMENTED — grounded)

All AI output carries `{text|answer|hypothesis, citations[], model, _attribution}`.
All claims in AI-generated text reference a record ID (INV-4). Ungrounded claims are defects.

| Endpoint | Function | UI surface |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /waterbody/{id}/report` | Situation report for one water body | ReportViewer panel |
| `GET /anomaly/{id}/explanation` | Hypothesis + advisory for anomaly | ExplanationCard |
| `POST /query` | Read-only NL query over store | NLQueryBox + GroundedAnswerPanel |

**Offline fallback:** When `ARGUS_AI_OFFLINE=true`, endpoints return templated text without
LLM inference. UI must render fallback text identically to live text; the `model` field
returns `"template"` in fallback mode.

### 2.3 Alert Pipeline (IMPLEMENTED)

| Alert type | Domain | Trigger | Message fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| HAB | `inland_wq` | z_score > 2.5σ AND bloom > 25 µg/L | domain, target, confidence, message, details |
| Flood risk | `weather_hydro` | risk_level ∈ {high, extreme} | Same; label = "not a measured flood" |
| Acid risk | `weather_hydro` | acid_risk_index ≥ 7.0 | Same; label = "NOT a pH measurement" |
| Oil (severity) | `marine_oil` | confidence-based, ETA-based | Same |

The alert delivery channel (webhook/email) is backend-configured. The frontend UI surfaces
alert history and current alert status; it does NOT trigger alerts.

### 2.4 Evidence Class Rules (INVARIANT — INV-3)

Every value displayed in the UI must reflect evidence_class. The UI must never imply that
modeled or inferred values were directly measured.

| evidence_class | Visual treatment | Required disclaimer |
|---|---|---|
| `measured` | No badge required | None required |
| `modeled` | "Modeled" badge (amber) | Source attribution (e.g. "Open-Meteo") |
| `inferred` | "Inferred" badge (blue) | Note derivation method (e.g. "DEM-derived") |

### 2.5 Open-Meteo Attribution (MANDATORY — CC BY 4.0)

Every screen or panel that displays weather/hydro predictions MUST include:

```
Weather data by Open-Meteo.com (CC BY 4.0)
```

This attribution is also present in API responses as `_attribution` field. Render it visibly
in the UI — not just in hover text. The footer of any weather/hydro panel is the canonical
placement.

```

### 4.2 AOI Context

AOI selection is global state (Zustand store). All AOI-scoped API calls use `selectedAoiId`.
The AOI selector lives in the persistent header. Changing the AOI resets all query caches
for AOI-scoped keys and re-fetches.

### 4.3 Deep Linking

All routes are deep-linkable. Anomaly explanation pages (`/waterbody/:id/anomaly/:predId`)
must be shareable — they should fetch their own data independently.

### 4.4 Navigation UX Rules

- Active route highlighted in sidebar nav
- Breadcrumb visible on all drill-down screens (WQ → Waterbody Name → Anomaly)
- Back button on explanation and report screens returns to parent
- AOI name always shown in header when an AOI is selected

}
```

- 404: resource not found — show `EmptyState` (not an error for lists)
- 422: validation error — show `ErrorMessage` with hint
- 500: internal error — show `ErrorMessage` with retry
- Network error — show `ErrorMessage` "API unavailable"; retry button

### 8.5 _attribution Field Rendering Rule

`_attribution` is present on all prediction and AI response endpoints. It MUST be rendered
as visible text in the corresponding panel — not just stored. Canonical placement: small text
in `AttributionFooter` component at the bottom of the panel. Never omit it.

## 9. State Management

### 9.1 Server State — TanStack Query v5

All server-fetched data is managed by TanStack Query. No manual fetch/useEffect for data
that has a React Query hook.

**Query client configuration:**

```typescript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 30_000,          // 30 seconds
      gcTime: 5 * 60_000,         // 5 minutes
      retry: 2,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
    },
  },
});
```

**Polling intervals by data type:**

| Data | Hook | refetchInterval |
|---|---|---|
| System health | `useHealth` | 30_000 (30s) |
| System status | `useStatus` | 60_000 (60s) |
| AOI list | `useAOIs` | false (stable) |
| Observations | `useObservations` | 300_000 (5m) |
| Predictions/frames | `usePredictions` | 300_000 (5m) |
| WQ forecasts | `useWQForecasts` | 300_000 (5m) |
| Anomalies | `useAnomalies` | 300_000 (5m) |
| Choke points | `useChokePoints` | false (stable) |
| Flood/acid risk | `useFloodRisk`, `useAcidRisk` | 300_000 (5m) |
| AI report | `useWQReport` | false (manual refresh) |
| AI explanation | `useExplanation` | false (stable) |

**Query key factory:**

```typescript
export const queryKeys = {
  health: () => ["health"] as const,
  status: () => ["status"] as const,
  aois: () => ["aois"] as const,
  aoi: (id: string) => ["aoi", id] as const,
  observations: (aoiId: string, obsType?: string, status?: string) =>
    ["obs", aoiId, obsType, status] as const,
  predictions: (aoiId: string) => ["preds", aoiId] as const,
  impact: (aoiId: string) => ["impact", aoiId] as const,
  chokePoints: (aoiId: string) => ["choke", aoiId] as const,
  floodRisk: (aoiId: string) => ["flood", aoiId] as const,
  acidRisk: (aoiId: string) => ["acid", aoiId] as const,
  waterbodies: () => ["waterbodies"] as const,
  wqObservations: (targetId: string, obsType?: string) =>
    ["wq-obs", targetId, obsType] as const,
  wqForecasts: (targetId: string) => ["wq-fore", targetId] as const,
  wqAnomalies: (targetId: string) => ["wq-anom", targetId] as const,
  wqReport: (targetId: string) => ["wq-report", targetId] as const,
  explanation: (predId: string) => ["explain", predId] as const,
};
```

### 9.2 Client State — Zustand

Three stores:

```typescript
// stores/aoiStore.ts
interface AOIStore {
  selectedAoiId: string | null;
  setSelectedAoiId: (id: string) => void;
}
// Persisted to localStorage key "argus:selectedAoiId"

// stores/mapStore.ts
interface MapStore {
  center: [number, number];
  zoom: number;
  layerVisibility: {
    observations: boolean;
    trajectory: boolean;
    impact: boolean;
    waterQuality: boolean;
    chokePoints: boolean;
    floodRisk: boolean;
    acidRisk: boolean;
  };
  setCenter: (center: [number, number]) => void;
  setZoom: (zoom: number) => void;
  toggleLayer: (layer: keyof MapStore["layerVisibility"]) => void;
}
// NOT persisted (map state resets on reload)

// stores/uiStore.ts
interface UIStore {
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean;
  alertDrawerOpen: boolean;
  citationViewerRecordId: string | null;
  setSidebarCollapsed: (v: boolean) => void;
  setAlertDrawerOpen: (v: boolean) => void;
  setCitationViewerRecordId: (id: string | null) => void;
}
```

### 9.3 AOI Context Invalidation

When `selectedAoiId` changes, invalidate all AOI-scoped queries:

```typescript
// In AOI selector onChange handler:
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["obs", prevAoiId] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["preds", prevAoiId] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["impact", prevAoiId] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["choke", prevAoiId] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["flood", prevAoiId] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["acid", prevAoiId] });
```

### 10.2 Vite Configuration

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://localhost:8000",
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ""),
      },
    },
  },
  build: {
    outDir: "../argus/api/static/dist",   // served by FastAPI
    emptyOutDir: true,
  },
});
```

**Note:** FastAPI serves `frontend/dist/` at `/app` (or `/`) via `StaticFiles`. The existing
`index.html` + `app.js` at `argus/api/static/` is replaced by the Vite build output.

### 10.3 Environment Variables

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000   # dev
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.argus.run   # prod (Cloud Run)
```

---

## 11. Design System

> **[IMPL v2.0]** The implemented design system differs from the v1.0 plan. See notes below.

### 11.1 Color Palette

**[IMPL]** Implemented colors (in `frontend/src/index.css` via Tailwind v4 `@theme` block):

```
Page background:   #080c14   — deeper than original plan (#0f172a)
Sidebar:           #0d1424
Surface-1:         #111827   — cards
Surface-2:         #131c2e
Surface-3:         #1a2540
Border default:    #1e293b

Text primary:      #f1f5f9   (slate-100)
Text secondary:    #94a3b8   (slate-400)
Text muted:        #475569   (slate-600)

Brand/accent:      #2563eb   (blue-600)

Status / Risk (CSS utility classes .risk-border-* applied as 3px left border):
  .risk-border-extreme  →  #ef4444 (red-500)
  .risk-border-high     →  #f97316 (orange-500)
  .risk-border-medium   →  #eab308 (yellow-500)
  .risk-border-low      →  #22c55e (green-500)

Evidence class badges (EvidenceClassBadge component):
  measured:  slate badge
  modeled:   amber badge
  inferred:  blue badge
```

### 11.2 Typography

**[IMPL]** Fonts loaded via `<link>` tags in `frontend/index.html` (not Bunny Fonts as planned):

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Type scale utility classes (defined in `index.css`):
- `.text-display`  — 2xl, bold, tight tracking
- `.text-heading`  — xl, semibold
- `.text-title`    — base, semibold
- `.text-body`     — sm, normal
- `.text-caption`  — xs, normal
- `.text-micro`    — 10px, normal
- `.text-label`    — 10px, medium, uppercase, tracking-wide

Metric values: `text-[28px] font-bold tabular-nums` (MetricCard component)

### 11.3 Spacing

Tailwind 4-pixel base. Implemented layout constants:
- Header height: `h-[52px]` (AppShell)
- Sidebar width: `w-[220px]` expanded; `w-[52px]` collapsed
- KPI bar: `grid grid-cols-4 gap-3 px-4 pt-4 pb-3` (Overview page)
- Map canvas: `flex-1 min-h-0` within flex parent

### 11.4 Shadow System

**[IMPL]** Added in design system v2. CSS custom properties:

```css
--shadow-xs: 0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);
--shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5), 0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);
--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5), 0 2px 4px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);
--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);
--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px -5px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5), 0 8px 10px -6px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);
```

Card variants using shadows: `elevated` (uses `--shadow-md`), `interactive` (hover lift via `.card-interactive`).

### 11.5 Motion / Animation

**[IMPL]** Animation via CSS keyframes (not Framer Motion — that dependency was not added):

```css
@keyframes fade-in-up   — .page-enter on all 12 page root containers
@keyframes scale-in     — .animate-scale-in on LayerManager panel open
@keyframes thinking     — .thinking-dot with staggered delay (NLQueryBox)
@keyframes pulse-dot    — domain status pulse indicators
```

Route transitions: `key={location.pathname}` on `<main>` in AppShell triggers `.page-enter` on
each navigation.

### 11.6 Dark Mode

Argus uses dark mode only (not togglable). There is no light mode.

**Visualization:** 2×2 grid of `DomainStatusCard`
**Status indicator:** green dot = complete, red dot = failed, amber = partial
**Shows:** domain_id, last_run_at (relative time), scenes_fetched, observations_created

### 13.12 System Quota Summary (inline with status)

Two `QuotaBar` components in `SystemStatusPanel`:
- CDSE: bytes_today / (daily_limit_gb × 1e9)
- Open-Meteo: calls_today / 10000

### 13.13 AI Confidence Badge (inline text badge)

**Component:** used inside `ExplanationCard`
**Values:** `"low"` | `"medium"` | `"high"` from ExplanationResponse
**Colors:** low=amber, medium=blue, high=green (not risk colors — confidence is different)

---

## 14. AI Experience

### 14.1 Citation Rendering

All AI text (`text`, `answer`, `hypothesis`) may contain inline citation references.
Citations are record IDs from the store (Observation IDs or Prediction IDs).

**Rendering rule:** The `citations` array in AI responses lists record IDs in order of
first appearance. Render inline markers as superscript numbers: `text[1]`, `text[2]`.
Superscripts are clickable → open `CitationViewer` with that record ID.

**CitationViewer lookup:** Record IDs are UUIDs. The viewer tries:
1. `GET /waterbody/{id}/observations` where obs id matches — if found, show ObservationSchema fields
2. Falls back to showing the raw ID if not resolvable

The citation panel is a slide-in drawer (not a modal) to preserve context.

### 14.2 Offline Mode Handling

When `model === "template"`:
- Render `OfflineBanner` at top of AI panel: "AI offline — showing templated report"
- Yellow background, visible without scrolling
- Report/answer text is still rendered (templated text is still useful)
- Do NOT show spinner indefinitely

### 14.3 Advisory Honesty Pattern

`ExplanationResponse.advisory` is the human-action recommendation from the AI. It must:
- Always be rendered above the fold (not inside an accordion)
- Prefix with "ADVISORY:" in bold
- Include the human-in-the-loop note: "Human verification recommended before action."
- The confidence badge must appear adjacent to the advisory, not separated

### 14.4 Read-Only Query Interface

Per OQ-E (resolved), the NL query interface is read-only. `POST /query` never executes
write actions. The `ReadOnlyNotice` component renders a permanent banner:

> "This interface is read-only. Write actions are not supported."

This notice must be visible without scrolling, above the query input box.

### 14.5 Loading States for AI

AI endpoints (report, explanation, query) can take 2–8 seconds. Use:
1. Skeleton placeholder (not spinner) for report text
2. "Generating…" text in the query submit button while request is in flight
3. Disable submit button during loading (prevent double submission)
4. On error: clear loading state + show `ErrorMessage` with "AI query failed. Retry?"

---

## 15. Phase 10 Implementation — DONE

> **[IMPL]** Phase 10 is complete as of 2026-06-29 (commits 6d258b7, 295bf27).
> The file paths below reflect the actual implementation, not the original plan.
> Original plan had `src/screens/` but implementation uses `src/pages/`.

if _DIST.exists():
    # Serve the React SPA; must be mounted AFTER all API routers
    app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory=_DIST, html=True), name="frontend")
```

## 19. Living Document Rules

### 19.1 When to Update This Document

Update this document (and increment the version number) when:

- A new screen is added to the navigation
- A component's TypeScript props interface changes
- A new API endpoint is added or an existing endpoint's response shape changes
- A design token (color, spacing) changes
- A technology is added, removed, or version-pinned
- A user journey changes materially
- An INV rule is added or modified that affects the UI

Do NOT update this document for:
- Implementation detail changes within an existing component
- Bug fixes that don't change the component's contract
- CSS class changes that don't affect the design system tokens

### 19.2 Versioning

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR`
- MAJOR: navigation structure change, new domain, or breaking API change
- MINOR: new component, updated props, new screen, design token change

Current version: **1.0**

### 19.3 Change Log

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 2026-06-28 | Initial document — Phase 10 blueprint complete |

### 19.4 Governance

This document is owned by the project lead (Josh). Changes that affect:
- Navigation architecture → require review before implementation
- INV rule enforcement in UI → require review and may require a new ADR
- Technology stack additions → require zero-cost compliance check (INV-1)

Deferred items (not in this version):
- Server-side PDF generation (`argus/api/routers/export.py`) — Phase 11
- Write operations in Admin panel (PATCH/POST AOI, alert config) — post-MVP
- Live alert feed via WebSocket — post-MVP
- Multi-tenant / multi-user support — post-MVP
- Dark/light mode toggle — post-MVP
