## 2026-06-27 — Session 3 — Repository Finalization, Deployment Strategy & Git Init

**Agent:** Claude claude-sonnet-4-6
**Duration:** Continuation session
**Tasks:** Repository cleanup, deployment strategy, git initialization, README rewrite

### What happened

- Audited and removed all root duplicate/stub files (ADR-0003/0004 at root, ARCHITECTURE.md
  stub, DATA_MODELS.md stub, PRD.md stub, phase-0.md stub)
- Deleted all Windows Zone.Identifier files (9 files)
- Fixed broken relative links in docs/adr/ files that still pointed at root paths
- Created docs/architecture/ trilogy: ARCHITECTURE.md v2.1, DATA_MODELS.md v2.1, STACK.md
- Added ADR-0007 (scheduler, DRAFT — pending Josh decision)
- Added ADR-0008 (deployment strategy, Accepted) — Vercel + GCP Cloud Run + Cloud Storage
- Updated CLAUDE.md with §13 (Git identity: CXLD10, conventional commits, no AI co-author)
  and §14 (production deployment constraints, INV-10 scale-to-zero)
- Updated STACK.md with production deployment section
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md §7 with production deployment (Vercel + Cloud Run)
- Rewrote README.md from scratch (production-quality open-source README)
- Created .gitignore, .gitattributes, .editorconfig
- Added .gitkeep to empty directories (data/eval, data/static, config/aois, docs/api)
- Created config/oil_types.yaml and config/settings.yaml
- Initialized git repository; first commit pending Josh confirmation of email

### Constraints established this session

- Git author: CXLD10 / GitHub no-reply email; no AI co-author attribution ever
- Production deployment: Vercel (frontend) + GCP Cloud Run (API) + GCS (artifacts)
- GCP $300 credits must last many months; scale-to-zero mandatory (INV-10)
- Conventional commits required; small atomic commits; feature branches → PRs

### State at end of session

- Documentation: 100% complete and internally consistent; one authoritative source per concept
- No root duplicate files remain
- Git initialized; initial commit pending (need Josh to confirm GitHub no-reply email format)
- First build task: F-000 (repo + tooling scaffold)

### Next session should

1. Confirm git email and push initial commit if not yet done
2. Begin F-000: create pyproject.toml, argus/ package, tests/ scaffold, CLI smoke test
3. Update BOARD.md: F-000 → IN_PROGRESS

## 2026-06-27 — Session 2 — Repository Governance Build

**Agent:** Claude claude-sonnet-4-6
**Duration:** Full session
**Tasks:** Pre-implementation governance build; no implementation code

### What happened

- Performed complete independent validation of all Session 1 outputs
- Found 5 SUPERSEDED/INVALID items (two-tier MVP, OQ-A, OQ-F, AGENTS.md, F-018-F-023 gap)
- Found 13 VALID items confirmed, 2 PARTIALLY VALID
- Identified 9 new issues not caught in Session 1
- Built the complete docs/ directory hierarchy (47 new files, 12 directories)
- Created CLAUDE.md agent operating guide
- Created all governance documents (VALIDATORS.md, HARNESS.md)
- Created spec_graph.md + spec_graph.yaml (complete specification graph)
- Updated PRD.md with new MVP definition
- Created OPEN_QUESTIONS.md with OQ-A and OQ-F resolutions
- Reconstructed ADR-0001 and ADR-0002 from references
- Created ADR-0005 (MVP redefinition) and ADR-0006 (oil type configurability)
- Created TESTING.md, CODING.md, QUOTAS.md standards
- Corrected phase-0.md to v2.0 entity names (critical fix)
- Created phase-1.md through phase-11.md feature specs
- Created all domain specs (D1-D4), predictor specs, ASSISTANT.md
- Updated README.md, BOARD.md, ROADMAP.md

### State at end of session

- Documentation: 100% structured; all files reference-consistent
- Implementation: 0% (no code written)
- First build task: F-000 (repo + tooling scaffold)
- All blocking documentation issues resolved

### Next session should

1. Begin F-000: create pyproject.toml, argus/ package, CLI, smoke test
2. Verify `make lint` and `make test` pass on a trivial scaffold
3. Update BOARD.md: F-000 → IN_PROGRESS
